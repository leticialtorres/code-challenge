# CodeChallenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.5.

## Development server

For install all dependencies for project, run in terminal `npm install` before all other commands.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` for generate a prod version for deploy the app, inside that dist folder, if running with success, the version will be generated.

Run `npm run test` for run the unit tests.

Run `npm run coverage` for run the unit tests.

Run `npm run lint` for run the lint and fix all possible issues for lint


## Solution
In this application I use a simple solution to list a limited character by API https://www.breakingbadapi.com/:
* Get a limited characters
* Detail Page with Angular Routes
* Lazy-Loading for a components
* Can update a quantity of character to list in environment file (change variable `quantityOfCharacters`)

## Highlights
* Unit Test
* Angular Components
* Angular Routes 
* Lazy-Loading
